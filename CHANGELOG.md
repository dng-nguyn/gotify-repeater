* Implemented Discord Webhook
  * The username is "Gotify Repeater" or the name of the Application receiving the notification.
  * Message is Gotify Message title as a "Header" with the proper message below. (Makes use of Discord Messages' new Header Support)
* Configurator Implemented
  * ClientToken - Client that the plugin will listen to. (May belong to another user if desired.)
  * ServerURL - Defaults to `http://localhost`. If you are deploying Gotify outside of docker or have HTTPS configured this may need to be modified. Should be the URL that accesses Gotify on the local machine it is running on.
